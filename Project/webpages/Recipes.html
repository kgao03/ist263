                <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>In 1874 there was a common joke in New York and other places around the country that involved telling someone that a man named Tom Collins was saying bad things about them.  They would start the conversation asking, “Have you seen Tom Collins?” and go on to tell the person that he was in a nearby bar or other business talking badly about them.  The goal was to upset that person enough that they would go looking for this fictional man.  The joke gained notoriety and became known as the Tom Collins Hoax of 1874.  The first Tom Collins recipe was printed in the 1876 book The Bartenders’ Guide by Jerry Thomas, who is known as the father of American mixology.  Thomas was based in New York and it is believed that he changed the name of the drink for John to Tom due to the hoax.  By 1878 the drink had grown popular and was being served in bars in New York City and around the country.

                <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>Before the gimlet became popular in 1953 it is believed that it was served to the sailors in the British Royal Navy as a means of fighting scurvy.  Rose’s Lime Juice was created in 1867 as a way to preserve lime juice without alcohol and it was used by the Navy.  By mixing the juice with Navy strength gin (114 proof!) the gimlet was born.  By the mid-20th century the gimlet was a popular cocktail with naval officers and in British society.

                    <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>Henry C. Ramos invented the Ramos gin fizz in 1888 at his bar, the Imperial Cabinet Saloon on Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. It was originally called a "New Orleans fizz” and is one of the city's most famous cocktails. Before Prohibition, the drink's popularity and exceptionally long 12-minute mixing time[6] had over 20 bartenders working at the Imperial at once making nothing but the Ramos gin fizz - and still struggling to keep up with demand. During the carnival of 1915, 32 staff members were on at once, just to shake the drink.
