                <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>In 1874 there was a common joke in New York and other places around the country that involved telling someone that a man named Tom Collins was saying bad things about them.  They would start the conversation asking, “Have you seen Tom Collins?” and go on to tell the person that he was in a nearby bar or other business talking badly about them.  The goal was to upset that person enough that they would go looking for this fictional man.  The joke gained notoriety and became known as the Tom Collins Hoax of 1874.  The first Tom Collins recipe was printed in the 1876 book The Bartenders’ Guide by Jerry Thomas, who is known as the father of American mixology.  Thomas was based in New York and it is believed that he changed the name of the drink for John to Tom due to the hoax.  By 1878 the drink had grown popular and was being served in bars in New York City and around the country.

                <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>Before the gimlet became popular in 1953 it is believed that it was served to the sailors in the British Royal Navy as a means of fighting scurvy.  Rose’s Lime Juice was created in 1867 as a way to preserve lime juice without alcohol and it was used by the Navy.  By mixing the juice with Navy strength gin (114 proof!) the gimlet was born.  By the mid-20th century the gimlet was a popular cocktail with naval officers and in British society.

                    <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>Henry C. Ramos invented the Ramos gin fizz in 1888 at his bar, the Imperial Cabinet Saloon on Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. It was originally called a "New Orleans fizz” and is one of the city's most famous cocktails. Before Prohibition, the drink's popularity and exceptionally long 12-minute mixing time[6] had over 20 bartenders working at the Imperial at once making nothing but the Ramos gin fizz - and still struggling to keep up with demand. During the carnival of 1915, 32 staff members were on at once, just to shake the drink.

                <p>
                    <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>The exact origin of the Pink Lady is not known for sure. Occasionally its invention is attributed to the interior architect and prominent society figure Elsie de Wolfe(1865-1950), but the recipe associated with her nevertheless clearly differs from the common recipes for the Pink Lady. The name of the cocktail itself is sometimes said to be taken from the 1911 Broadway musical by Ivan Caryll of the same name, or named in the honour of its star Hazel Dawn who was known as "The Pink Lady". During the prohibition era (1920-1933) the cocktail was already widely known. In those years it was a popular drink at the Southern Yacht Club in New Orleans, where it was offered under the name Pink Shimmy as well. Its recipe was due to Armond Schroeder, an assistant manager at the club. The popularity of the Pink Lady might partially be explained by the frequently poor quality of gin during the prohibition era, due to which there was a need to mask the gin's bad taste.
                    At the latest in the 1930s the Pink Lady started to acquire the image of a typical "female" or "girly" drink due to its name and sweet creamy flavor usually associated with a woman's taste in publications like Esquire's Handbook for Hosts (1949). It is said of the Hollywood star and sex symbol Jayne Mansfield, that she used to drink a Pink Lady before a meal. Subsequently, the cocktail fell out of favour with male cocktail critics, who were put off by its alleged "female" nature. The writer and bartender Jack Townsend speculated in his publication The Bartender's Book (1951) that the very non-threatening appearance of the Pink Lady may have appealed to women who did not have much experience with alcohol. At one point the Pink Lady ended up on Esquire's list of the ten worst cocktails.

                <p>
                    <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>The Clover Club Cocktail is a drink that pre-dates Prohibition in the United States, and is named for the Philadelphia men's club of the same name, which met in the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel on South Broad Street. The Clover Club itself dates to 1896, as seen in the 1897 book, The Clover Club of Philadelphia, page 172 by Mary R. Deacon. Brooklyn's Clover Club restaurant claims that the Philadelphia men's club dates to 1882 and lasted until "the 1920s."

                <p>
                    <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>The exact origin of the martini is unclear. The name may derive from the Martini brand of vermouth. Another popular theory suggests it evolved from a cocktail called the Martinez served sometime in the early 1860s at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, which people frequented before taking an evening ferry to the nearby town of Martinez, California. Alternatively, residents of Martinez say a bartender in their town created the drink, while another source indicates that the drink was named after the town. Indeed, a "Martinez Cocktail" was first described in Jerry Thomas's 1887 edition of his Bartender's Guide, How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks

                    <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>The more popular modern version of the cocktail contains tequila, orange juice, and grenadine, and was created by Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice in the early 1970s while working as young bartenders at the Trident in Sausalito, California north of San Francisco. In 1972, at a private party at the Trident organized by Bill Graham to kick off the Rolling Stones' 1972 tour in America, Mick Jagger had one of the cocktails, liked it, and he and his entourage started drinking them. They later ordered them all across America, even dubbing the tour itself their "cocaine and tequila sunrise tour".

                <p>
                    <strong>Background story:</strong> <br>The drink gets its name from the way it is commonly consumed; the usual procedure is to leave about a fifth of the glass empty to allow the drink to fizz, then to hold one's hand over the top of the glass and then slam it onto a hard surface to mix it. The slamming action releases gas bubbles from the mixed drink causing it to foam vigorously. It will then quickly escape the glass if not imbibed immediately, the result (and intention) of which is swift intoxication.
