        As an indoor person, I love video games and movies. I mostly play FPS game such as CSGO, Apex legend, PUBG, etc. My favorite movie is the John Wick series and because of that, my only outdoor activity is going to the range and train for the IPSC competition. Also, I am a “professional bartender” at my home bar. Although I am allergic to all kinds of alcohols, making cocktails can still give me so much fun.
