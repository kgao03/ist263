            <h2>Personal info</h2>

             <p>
                 My major is <strong>Information Management & Technology</strong>, interested in web design, database management and cyber security.<br>
                As an indoor person, I love video games and movies. I mostly play FPS game such as CSGO, Apex legend, PUBG, etc. <br>
                My favorite movie is the John Wick series and because of that, my only outdoor activity is going to the range and train for the IPSC competition.<br> 
                Also, I am a “professional bartender” at my home bar. Although I am allergic to all kinds of alcohols, making cocktails can still give me so much fun.
